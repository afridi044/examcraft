TASK: Generate ${dto.num_flashcards} educational flashcards about "${dto.topic_name}"

DIFFICULTY LEVEL: ${dto.difficulty}/5 - ${difficultyDescription}

FLASHCARD QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
1. Questions should be clear, specific, and unambiguous
2. Questions should promote active recall, not passive recognition
3. Answers should be comprehensive but concise (1-3 sentences typically)
4. Each flashcard should test a distinct concept, fact, or skill
5. Avoid questions that can be answered with simple yes/no unless testing specific facts
6. Use varied question formats to maintain engagement
7. Ensure answers are accurate and educational

QUESTION DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Use "What is...?", "How does...?", "Why does...?", "When should...?" formats
- Test understanding, not just memorization
- Include application-based questions for higher difficulty levels
- Create questions that require thinking and synthesis
- Avoid overly complex or confusing wording
- Focus on the most important concepts that students need to know

ANSWER GUIDELINES:
- Provide complete but concise answers (maximum 50 words)
- Include key details that aid understanding within the word limit
- Add context when helpful for learning, but keep it brief
- Ensure answers directly address the question asked
- Use clear, educational language appropriate for the difficulty level
- Keep answers focused and to the point to fit flashcard format

TOPIC FOCUS: ${dto.topic_name}${contentContext}${additionalInstructions}

RESPONSE FORMAT: Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact structure:
{
  "flashcards": [
    {
      "question": "Clear, specific question that tests understanding and promotes active recall?",
      "answer": "Concise answer (max 50 words) that directly addresses the question and fits flashcard format.",
      "difficulty": ${dto.difficulty},
      "explanation": "Brief explanation of why this concept is important or how it connects to broader topics."
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
- Start your response with { and end with }
- Include exactly ${dto.num_flashcards} flashcards
- Ensure all questions are relevant to "${dto.topic_name}"
- Keep answers under 50 words to fit flashcard UI format
- Make explanations educational and connect to broader learning objectives
- Vary question types and cognitive levels within the difficulty range
- Focus on concepts that promote long-term retention and understanding
- Create flashcards that would be valuable for exam preparation and knowledge mastery`;
