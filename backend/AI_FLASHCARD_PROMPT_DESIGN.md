# AI Flashcard Generation Prompt Design

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive AI prompt design for generating consistent, high-quality flashcards in the ExamCraft application. The prompt is specifically designed for spaced repetition learning and active recall, integrating seamlessly with the flashcard creation form to ensure optimal educational value.

## Form Parameters Integration

The AI prompt takes into account all form parameters from the flashcard creation interface:

### 1. **Topic Information**
- **Topic**: Primary subject area for flashcard focus
- **Subtopic**: Specific area within the main topic for targeted flashcards
- **Combined Topic Name**: When both topic and subtopic are provided, they're combined as `"Topic - Subtopic"`

### 2. **Generation Configuration**
- **Number of Flashcards**: Determines the scope and variety needed (1-50 flashcards)
- **Difficulty Level (1-5)**: Mapped to specific cognitive levels and complexity

### 3. **Content & Instructions**
- **Content Source**: Study material, notes, or specific content to base flashcards on
- **Additional Instructions**: Custom requirements for flashcard generation

## Difficulty Level Mapping

The prompt includes detailed difficulty descriptions optimized for flashcard learning:

| Level | Description | Cognitive Skills | Flashcard Focus |
|-------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1 (Beginner) | Basic definitions, fundamental concepts, simple recall | Knowledge, terminology | Core vocabulary, basic facts |
| 2 (Easy) | Simple concepts, straightforward understanding | Comprehension, basic connections | Concept understanding, simple relationships |
| 3 (Medium) | Moderate complexity, some analysis required | Understanding, application | Applied knowledge, problem-solving |
| 4 (Hard) | Complex scenarios, critical thinking | Synthesis, advanced application | Complex relationships, analysis |
| 5 (Expert) | Advanced concepts, deep understanding | Mastery, expert insights | Expert-level connections, advanced applications |

## Flashcard Quality Requirements

The prompt enforces strict quality standards specific to effective flashcard design:

### Question Design Principles
- **Active Recall Focus**: Questions promote active retrieval rather than passive recognition
- **Clarity and Specificity**: Questions are unambiguous and test specific knowledge
- **Varied Formats**: Uses "What is...?", "How does...?", "Why does...?", "When should...?" patterns
- **Cognitive Engagement**: Questions require thinking and synthesis, not just memorization
- **Single Concept Focus**: Each flashcard tests one distinct concept or skill

### Answer Guidelines
- **Word Limit Compliance**: Answers are limited to maximum 50 words to fit flashcard UI
- **Comprehensive but Concise**: Answers are complete within the word limit
- **Direct Response**: Answers directly address the question asked
- **Educational Value**: Answers include key details for learning within constraints
- **Appropriate Complexity**: Language and detail level match the difficulty setting
- **UI-Friendly Format**: Designed to fit properly within flashcard card interface

### Learning Optimization
- **Spaced Repetition Friendly**: Designed for long-term retention
- **Memory Principles**: Based on cognitive science research for effective learning
- **Distinct Concepts**: Each flashcard tests different aspects to avoid redundancy
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Questions scale appropriately within the chosen difficulty level
- **UI Constraints**: Answers and explanations optimized for flashcard display format

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Prompt Structure
1. **Expert Role Definition**: AI positioned as educational content creator and cognitive scientist
2. **Task Specification**: Clear definition of flashcard generation requirements
3. **Difficulty Mapping**: Detailed descriptions for consistent complexity
4. **Quality Framework**: Comprehensive guidelines for question and answer design
5. **Content Integration**: Smart use of provided study material and instructions
6. **Learning Principles**: Integration of spaced repetition and active recall concepts

### Content Integration Strategy
- **Primary Source Priority**: When content source is provided, it takes precedence
- **Supplementary Knowledge**: AI fills gaps with essential topic knowledge
- **Contextual Adaptation**: Questions and answers are tailored to provided material
- **Learning Objective Alignment**: Flashcards support the study goals implied by the content

### API Configuration
- **Model**: `deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528-qwen3-8b:free`
- **Temperature**: 0.3 (reduced from 0.7 for more consistent results)
- **Max Tokens**: 4000 (sufficient for multiple flashcards with explanations)
- **Response Format**: Strict JSON-only responses
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized parameters for educational content
- **Word Limits**: Answers max 50 words, explanations max 30 words for UI compatibility

### Topic and Subtopic Handling
Just like the quiz system, flashcards properly handle topic and subtopic combinations:

- **Topic Only**: `"JavaScript"` → AI focuses on general JavaScript concepts
- **Topic + Subtopic**: `"JavaScript - React Hooks"` → AI creates React Hooks-specific flashcards
- **Dynamic Topic Creation**: New subtopics are created in the database when needed

## Benefits of This Design

### 1. **Learning Effectiveness**
- Optimized for spaced repetition and active recall
- Based on cognitive science principles for memory retention
- Questions designed to promote deep understanding
- Progressive difficulty scaling within each level

### 2. **Educational Quality**
- Focus on distinct, important concepts
- Varied question types to maintain engagement
- Educational explanations that connect to broader topics
- Clear, accurate answers that aid comprehension

### 3. **User Experience**
- Seamless integration with all form parameters
- Intelligent use of provided content and instructions
- Consistent quality across different topics and difficulty levels
- Scalable approach for different numbers of flashcards

### 4. **Consistency and Reliability**
- Lower temperature setting for more predictable outputs
- Detailed difficulty descriptions ensure appropriate complexity
- Structured format requirements prevent output variations
- Enhanced system prompts guide AI behavior

## Flashcard Design Philosophy

### Active Recall Optimization
The prompt is specifically designed to create flashcards that optimize active recall:

- **Retrieval Practice**: Questions require students to actively retrieve information
- **Desirable Difficulties**: Appropriate challenge level to promote learning
- **Spaced Repetition Ready**: Designed for optimal spacing algorithms
- **Memory Consolidation**: Questions that help move information to long-term memory

### Cognitive Load Management
- **Single Concept Focus**: Each flashcard tests one clear concept to avoid overload
- **Progressive Complexity**: Difficulty scales appropriately within levels
- **Clear Formatting**: Questions and answers are well-structured and easy to process
- **Contextual Support**: Explanations provide helpful context without overwhelming

## Comparison with Quiz Generation

| Aspect | Quiz Generation | Flashcard Generation |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Primary Goal** | Assessment and evaluation | Learning and retention |
| **Question Types** | Multiple choice with distractors | Direct question-answer pairs |
